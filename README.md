# ROS for SLAM and Path Coverage

## Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)

SLAM basically consists on constructing maps of unknown environments or update existing ones. SLAM is key in approaches for self-driving cars and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). We played a little bit with ROS + SLAM (multiple algorithms) + Turtlebot. If you are curious, check [that](https://github.com/S2-group/slam-path-coverage-missions/tree/SLAM-mission-rough).

## Coverage Path Planning (CPP) 

CPP is the task that defines a path to cover all points of an area. This is the case for automated lawnmowers and vacuum robots. Are you interested in running this with ROS? Then, check our [experiment setup](https://github.com/S2-group/slam-path-coverage-missions/tree/path-coverage/path_coverage).
